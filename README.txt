--2k Player Web Scraper--

This is a project I made a few months ago because some friends and I needed some random 
NBA2k player generator for the games we would play together.

Due to the lack of a database including all 2k23 players including both current and past players, I decided to create my own web scraper which would put all the players in one table
which could be used for randomised searches based on an inserted lowest overall rating threshold later on. The scraper was made using WebDriver and BeautifulSoup packages.
